# OS Problems

This repository contains exercises and solutions for various Operating Systems topics, including process management,piping and many other concepts (files I/O, folder creation/traversal etc).


## Prerequisites
-Linux (for syscalls); <br>
-C compiler (ex:GCC);

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Petrutz14/OS_Problems.git

Note: Some problems require additional input or data files to run correctly.

2. Compile and run the code (I recomend GCC):
```bash

./<executable_name_you_want> <input_1> <input_2> ... <input_n>
```
Note: don't use <> when writing the name!
